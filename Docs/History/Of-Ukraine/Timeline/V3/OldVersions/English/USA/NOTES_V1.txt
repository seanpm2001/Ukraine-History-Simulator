Notes for V3 timeline

WW1 was moved 1 entry ahead to make room for the Black Sea Cossack Host era
4 new eras were added in V3, they include:
- 6.1: Kingdom of Ruthenia
- 7.1: Ruthenian Lands
- 8.1: Zaporizhian Sich
- 9.1: Black Sea Cossack Host
Pre-history up to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is a bit inaccurate, and needs to be fixed
