# Development scenarios

## What happens to the project if Russia succeeds in invading Ukraine?

This is an undesired scenario, and I hope that the situation doesn't come to this. If Russia is to "succeed" in their invasion and annexation of Ukraine, this project will keep going. Ukraine has been under control of various countries during its history, so if the invasion is "won" by Russia, the game will reflect that change. There will be in-game scenarios of Ukraine winning the battle (if they haven't already by this time, in the timeline where Russia loses)

This is a history game, and will reflect history, although I sincerely hope Ukraine remains an independant country.
